# Welcome to Humainary

**Revolutionizing Observability through Open Interfaces and Next-Generation Signal Intelligence**

Humainary hosts open-source interfaces designed to transform how we observe, understand, and interact with complex digital systems. Our goal is nothing short of revolutionizing observability by shifting from traditional metrics and logging toward meaningful signal interpretation and systemic understanding.

## Our Projects

### [Substrates](https://github.com/humainary-io/substrates-api-java)
A foundational API for seamless signal flow management across distributed systems. Substrates enable structured, dynamic instrumentation for advanced observability, simulation, and adaptive control.

- **Conduits & Circuits**: Intuitive APIs to manage channels, data flow, and cross-process communications.
- **Holonic Design**: Modular and hierarchical structure for complex system management.

### [Serventis](https://github.com/humainary-io/serventis-api-java)
An innovative observability and monitoring API based on semiotics and signaling theory. Serventis introduces structured interfaces for sensing system conditions and assessing operational health dynamically.

- **Monitors API**: Standardized interface for condition assessment and statistical confidence.
- **Services API**: Shift from raw metrics to contextual signal interpretation.

### âœ¨ Signetics *(coming soon!)*
A groundbreaking framework for creating, transforming, and orchestrating domain-specific signs and signals. Signetics expands beyond observability, enabling deep semantic interconnection across systems and contexts.

- **Domain-Specific Semantics**: Define rich schemas tailored to specific ecosystems.
- **Inter-contextual Sign Management**: Dynamic transformation and interpretation of signs across domains.
